            <p>Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them. One of the resources that Jane finds quoted often in academic papers is the 1923 text <em>English for Engineers</em> written by S. A. Harbarger. She decides that this is a useful resource to examine for her project, and makes a note of the title, author, and year in her Google Docs list of resources that she is compiling. After a quick search in I-Share, she notices that it is available at the University of Illinois library in Chicago; she makes a note of this as well in her list of resources. Although she has to work on another project, she knows that she can easily come back to her research notes and resume work.</p>
